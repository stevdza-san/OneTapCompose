I'm not planning to maintain this library anymore, because there's already a better solution which is KMP ready, and available for both Android and iOS. Please do migrate to a new KMP Auth library <a href="https://github.com/mirzemehdi/KMPAuth">HERE</a>

This library allow you to easily integrate One-Tap Sign in with Google(<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/sign-in/credential-manager">Credential Manager</a>) to your project with Jetpack Compose. 
It hides all the boilerplate code away from you. You get an extracted <a href="#google-user">Google User</a> object that you can use to obtain a basic user information. And there's a new <a href="#sign-in-with-google-button">OneTapGoogleButton</a> composable that you can use out of the box, with various customization options.

### Gradle

Add the dependency below to your module's `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.stevdza-san:OneTapCompose:1.0.14")
}
```
Add a repository in your `settings.gradle` file:
```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven(url = "https://jitpack.io")
    }
}
```
# Usage

Before you can use this library, you need to create a new project on a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>.
You need to create OAuth Client ID <i>(ANDROID & WEB)</i>, because you will need that same Client ID (WEB), in order to implement One-Tap Sign in with Google.
</br></br>
After that, just call `OneTapSignInWithGoogle()` function, and pass that same information you've obtained through Google Cloud Platform.
You will also pass `OneTapSignInState`, because that state is used later to trigger One-Tap dialog.

```kotlin
    val state = rememberOneTapSignInState()
    OneTapSignInWithGoogle(
        state = state,
        clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        onTokenIdReceived = { tokenId ->
            Log.d("LOG", tokenId)
        },
        onDialogDismissed = { message ->
            Log.d("LOG", message)
        }
    )
```

To trigger One-Tap dialog, just call `open()` function.

```kotlin
Button(onClick = { state.open() }) {
    Text(text = "Sign in")
}
```

# Google User

And if you wish to extract a user information from a token id, that's now possible too! `getUserFromTokenId()` allows you to do exactly that. It returns a `GoogleUser` object, that contains lot's of different information related to that same user.

```kotlin
onTokenIdReceived = { tokenId ->
    Log.d("LOG", getUserFromTokenId(tokenId).toString())
}
```

Available `GoogleUser` information:
- Sub
- Email
- EmailVerified
- FullName
- GivenName
- FamilyName
- Picture
- IssuedAt
- ExpirationTime
- Locale

# Sign in with Google Button

You can also use a drop-in opinionated button composable that works out of the box and encapsulates all the
sign in logic and follows Google's [Sign in with Google Branding Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines):

```kotlin
OneTapGoogleButton(
    clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
)
```

According to the design guidelines, the button is available in 3 themes:
1. Dark
2. Light
3. Neutral

<img src="https://github.com/stevdza-san/OneTapCompose/blob/master/previews/ButtonLight.png" width="300"/>
<img src="https://github.com/stevdza-san/OneTapCompose/blob/master/previews/ButtonNeutral.png" width="300"/>

You can customise the theme using the `theme` parameter in the composable:
```kotlin
OneTapGoogleButton(
    clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    theme = GoogleButtonTheme.Neutral
)
```

The buttons are also available in icon-only mode for all the themes:

<img src="https://github.com/stevdza-san/OneTapCompose/blob/master/previews/IconButtonNeutral.png" width="100"/>

It can be activated using the `iconOnly` parameter in the composable:

```kotlin
OneTapGoogleButton(
    clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    iconOnly = true
)
```

## Button API
| Name  | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| clientId  | String  | CLIENT ID (Web) of your project, that you can obtain from a Google Cloud Platform.  |
| state  | OneTapSignInState  | One-Tap Sign in State. Can be used to detect whether the sign in operation has already been triggered.  |
| rememberAccount  | Boolean  | Remember a selected account to sign in with, for an easier and quicker sign in process.  |
| nonce  | String?  | Optional nonce that can be used when generating a Google Token ID  |
| onTokenIdReceived  | ((String) -> Unit)?  | Lambda that will be triggered after a successful authentication. Returns a Token ID.  |
| onUserReceived  | ((String) -> Unit)?  | This function returns a GoogleUser object using the received tokenId.  |
| onDialogDismissed  | ((String) -> Unit)?  | Lambda that will be triggered when One-Tap dialog disappears. Returns a message in a form of a string.  |
| iconOnly  | Boolean  | Whether the button should only show the Google logo.  |
| theme  | GoogleButtonTheme  | Sets the button style to either be Light, Dark, or Neutral which is in accordance with the official Google design guidelines.  |
| colors  | ButtonColors  | ButtonColors that will be used to resolve the colors for this button in different states.  |
| border  | BorderStroke?  | the border to draw around the container of this button  |
| shape  | Shape  | defines the shape of this button's container, border (when border is not null)  |
| onClick  | (() -> Unit)?  | called when this button is clicked  |

# Release Build
If you are planning on publishing your app, be sure to generate a release SHA-1 fingerprint, and create a new oAuth credentials on your Google Cloud Platform project.
Also when you upload your app on Play Console, you'll find there a section (`Release > Setup > App signing`) that will generate the release SHA-1 fingerprint. You take it and create another oAuth credential.

# Troubleshoot
In some cases you may encounter <i>"Google Account not Found."</i> message inside `onDialogDismiss` lambda, even if you have already connected a Google account
on your Android Emulator. Android emulators are prone to that issues <i>(Not sure why and when that's gonna get fixed)</i>.
My suggestion in that case is to try and add a Google account on some other Android Emulator.
If that doesn't work either, then use a real device instead.

> It's important to implement your own rate limiting of One Tap sign-in prompts. If you don't, and a user cancels several prompts in a row, the One Tap client will not prompt the user for the next 24 hours.

Also to debug your app better, check the logs and search for a `OneTapCompose` tag, it might contain additional information to help you out with your issue.
